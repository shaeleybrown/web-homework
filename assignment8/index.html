            <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <p>Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br />
             You know that I caught it<br />
             Bad, bad boy<br />
             Shiny toy with a price<br />
             You know that I bought it
            </p>
            <p>Killing me slow, out the window<br />
                I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br />
                devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br />
                What doesn't kill me makes me what you more
            </p>
            <p>And its new, the shape of your body<br />
                It's blue, the feeling I've got<br />
                And its ooh, woah, oh<br />
                It's a cruel summer<br />
                It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br />
                No rules in breakable heaven<br />
                But ooh, woah, oh<br />
                It's a cruel summer<br />
                with you
            </p>
            <p>Hang your head low<br />
                In the glow of the vending machine<br />
                I'm not dying<br />
                You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br />
                We're not trying
            </p>
            <p> So cut the headlights, summeer's a knife<br />
                I'm always wating for you just to cut to the bone<br />
                Devils roll the dice, angles roll their eyes<br />
                And if i bleed, you'll be the last to know
            </p>
            <p>Oh, its newm the shape of your body<br />
                It's blue, the feeling I've got<br />
                And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br />
                It's a cruel summer<br />
                it's cool, thats what I tell 'em<br />
                No rules in breakable heaven<br />
                But ooh, whoa, oh<br />
                It's a cruel summer<br />
                With you
            </p>
            <p> I'm drunk in the back of the car<br />
                AMd I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br />
                I said "im fine" but it wasn't true<br />
                I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br />
                and I snuck in through the garden gate<br />
                Every night that summer just to seal my fate<br />
                and I screamed for whatever it's worth<br />
                "I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br />
                He looks up grinning like a devil
            </p>
            <p>It's new, the shape of your body<br />
                It's blue, the feeling I've got<br />
                and it's ooh, whoa, oh<br />
                It's a cruel summer<br />
                it's cool, that's what I tell em<br />
                No rules, in breakable heaven<br />
                But ooh whoa, oh<br />
                it's a cruel cummer <br />
                with you
            </p>
            <p>I'm drunk in the back of the car<br />
                And I cried like a body coming home from the bar<br />
                Said "i'm fine," but it wasn't true<br />
                I don't wanna keep secrects just to keep you<br />
                And I snuck in through the garden gate<br />
                Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br />
                And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br />
                "i love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
