            The animals get together in the barn to listen to Old Major, one of the main characters. He is a boar, and speaks about his dream. He says that the Man is the oppressor of all the animals, and the animals would be a better life if they rebelled and ran from the farm. He explained they need to advoid all humans and then teaches the animals a song called Beasts of England.
